# Elm loader [![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/elm-webpack-loader.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-webpack-loader) [![Travis build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elm-community/elm-webpack-loader.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/elm-community/elm-webpack-loader) 

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) loader for the [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) programming language.

It is aware of Elm dependencies and tracks them. This means that in watch
mode, if you `require` an Elm module from a Webpack entry point, not only will
that `.elm` file be watched for changes, but any other Elm modules it imports will
be watched for changes as well.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save elm-webpack-loader
```

## Usage

Documentation: [rules](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rule)

`webpack.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{
      test: /\.elm$/,
      exclude: [/elm-stuff/, /node_modules/],
      use: {
        loader: 'elm-webpack-loader',
        options: {}
      }
    }]
  }
};
```

See the [examples](#example) section below for the complete webpack configuration.

### Options

#### cwd (default null) *Recommended*

You can add `cwd=elmSource` to the loader:

```js
var elmSource = __dirname + '/elm/path/in/project'
  ...
  use: {
    loader: 'elm-webpack-loader',
    options: {
      cwd: elmSource
    }
  }
  ...
```

`cwd` should be set to the same directory as your `elm.json` file. You can use this to specify a custom location within your project for your elm files. Note, this
will cause the compiler to look for **all** elm source files in the specified directory. This
approach is recommended as it allows the compile to watch elm.json as well as every file
in the source directories.

#### Optimize (default is true in production mode)

Set this to true to compile bundle in optimized mode. See <https://elm-lang.org/0.19.0/optimize> for more information.

```js
  ...
  use: {
    loader: 'elm-webpack-loader',
    options: {
      optimize: true
    }
  }
  ...
```

#### Debug (default is true in development mode)

Set this to true to enable Elm's time traveling debugger. 

```js
  ...
  use: {
    loader: 'elm-webpack-loader',
    options: {
      debug: true
    }
  }
  ...
```

#### RuntimeOptions (default `undefined`)

This allows you to control aspects of how `elm make` runs with [GHC Runtime Options](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runtime_control.html).

The 0.19 version of `elm make` supports a limited set of those options, the most useful of which is
for profiling a build.  To profile a build use the settings `runtimeOptions: '-s'`, which will print
out information on how much time is spent in mutations, in the garbage collector, etc.

_Note_: Using the flags below requires building a new `elm make` binary with `-rtsopts` enabled!

If you notice your build spending a lot of time in the garbage collector, you can likely optimize it
with some additional flags to give it more memory, `e.g. -A128M -H128M -n8m`.

```js
  ...
  use: {
    loader: 'elm-webpack-loader',
    options: {
      runtimeOptions: ['-A128M', '-H128M', '-n8m']
    }
  }
  ...
```

#### Files (default - path to 'required' file)

elm make allows you to specify multiple modules to be combined into a single bundle

```sh
elm make Main.elm Path/To/OtherModule.elm --output=combined.js
```

The `files` option allows you to do the same within webpack

```js
module: {
  loaders: [
    {
      test: /\.elm$/,
      exclude: [/elm-stuff/, /node_modules/],
      loader: 'elm-webpack-loader',
      options: {
        files: [
          path.resolve(__dirname, "path/to/Main.elm"),
          path.resolve(__dirname, "Path/To/OtherModule.elm")
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
(Note: It's only possible to pass array options when using the object style of loader configuration.)

You're then able to use this with

```js
import Elm from "./elm/Main";

Elm.Main.init({node: document.getElementById("main")});
Elm.Path.To.OtherModule.init({node: document.getElementById("other")});
```

#### maxInstances (default `undefined`)

You can add `maxInstances=8` to the loader:

```js
  ...
  use: {
    loader: 'elm-webpack-loader',
    options: {
      maxInstances: 8
    }
  }
  ...
```

Set a limit to the number of maxInstances of elm that can spawned.

##### Hot module reloading

Hot module reloading is supported by installing [elm-hot-webpack-loader](https://github.com/klazuka/elm-hot-webpack-loader)
and adding it to your list of loaders. It should look something like this:

```js
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.elm$/,
      exclude: [/elm-stuff/, /node_modules/],
      use: [
        { loader: 'elm-hot-webpack-loader' },
        { loader: 'elm-webpack-loader' }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: `elm-hot-webpack-loader` must be placed in the list immediately *before* `elm-webpack-loader`.


#### Upstream options

All options are sent down as an `options` object to node-elm-compiler. For example, you can
explicitly pick the local `elm` binary by setting the option `pathToElm`:

```js
  ...
  use: {
    loader: 'elm-webpack-loader',
    options: {
      pathToElm: 'node_modules/.bin/elm'
    }
  }
  ...
```

For a list all possible options,
[consult the source](https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-elm-compiler/blob/3fde73d/index.js#L12-L23).

## Notes

### Example

You can find an example in the `example` folder.
To run:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

You can have webpack watch for changes with: `npm run watch`

You can run the webpack dev server with: `npm run dev`

For a full featured example project that uses elm-webpack-loader see [pmdesgn/elm-webpack-starter](https://github.com/pmdesgn/elm-webpack-starter) .

### noParse

Webpack can complain about precompiled files (files compiled by `elm make`).
You can silence this warning with
[noParse](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#module-noparse). You can see it in use
in the example.

```js
  module: {
    rules: [...],
    noParse: [/.elm$/]
  }
```

## Revisions
